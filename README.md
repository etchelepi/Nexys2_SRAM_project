# Nexys2_SRAM_project
This project was to augment the limited memory on a 8051 chip by providing a way to access the 16MB SRAM chip on the NEXYS 2 board via the Spartan 3E FPGA.

The IO configuration is setup to forward all values out to a connected LA to read out the data and not the actual ports needed.
